One of the reasons is probably because you haven't learned how to make use of abstraction yet. In the programs we create, there are many details we don't need to understand to understand how our program works, but new programmers usually get stuck at these details they don't need to worry about. Abstraction is about not caring about these unnecessary implementation details, and experienced programmers use it all the time. Let's take a look at some examples.")]),t._v(" "),a("iframe",{attrs:{width:"560",height:"314",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wSJbP6f2W4",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:""}}),t._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"lecture-material"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#lecture-material"}},[t._v("#")]),t._v(" Lecture material")]),t._v(" "),a("ul",[a("li",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"python-abstraction.pdf"}},[t._v("python-abstraction.pdf")])]),t._v(" "),a("li",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"python-abstraction.pptx"}},[t._v("python-abstraction.pptx")])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=o.exports}}]);
